There are two variants of QadSSH (quick-and-dirty SSH script).

First, QadSSH v1 which is a simple script with some limitations that might
need some modification to satisfy your needs.

Then, there is QadSSH v2 which is an enhanced variant of QadSSH v1 with
additional features and without the limitations QadSSH v1 has.

For details see the 'README' file inside the corresponding sub-diretcories.
