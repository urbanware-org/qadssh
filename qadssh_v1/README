    Definition

        QadSSH v2 is a simple script to use in combination with Bash aliases
        for quicker SSH access to remote systems.

    Details

        In order to speed up the SSH login process every time you need to
        connect to a remote host via SSH, you can use this script in
        combination with Bash aliases.

        So, to use the script for your network, you may have to edit the code
        and change the network specific details.

        As the name implies the project is just a quick-and-dirty solution in
        order to save some time.

        Notice that QadSSH v1 was initially written for class C networks. You
        may have a look at QadSSH v2 for more features:

        Feel free to modify!

    Example

        Let us assume that there are 4 VLANs inside the network

            VLAN 1: 192.168.1.0/24
            VLAN 2: 192.168.2.0/24
            VLAN 3: 192.168.3.0/24
            VLAN 4: 192.168.4.0/24

        and you need to connect to various systems inside each of the VLANs
        with a certain user.

        You can do that the usual way, e.g.

            $ ssh johndoe@192.168.1.24
            $ ssh foobar@192.168.2.10
            $ ssh someone@192.168.3.98
            $ ssh hansgruber@192.168.4.60

        or by adding Bash aliases into your '.bashrc' file for those VLANs
        in combination with qadssh:

            alias 1='/opt/qadssh/qadssh.sh 1'
            alias 2='/opt/qadssh/qadssh.sh 2'
            alias 3='/opt/qadssh/qadssh.sh 3'
            alias 4='/opt/qadssh/qadssh.sh 4'

        After reloading the Bash aliases file you can simply type

            $ 1 24

        to access the system 192.168.1.24 with the current user with whom this
        script was started. You can also set a default user inside the script
        which will be used when no username was given.

        You can give a specific name as an argument as follows

            $ 1 28 johndoe

        which would establish a connection as 'johndoe' with 192.168.1.28,

            $ 2 10 foobar

        establishes a connection as 'foobar' with 192.168.2.10 and so on.
